				<p>Being successful in a Public Safety Communications Center means knowing how to quickly and accurately access a wide array of information and resources.</p>

				<p>Dispatchers are not expected to know everything; however, they should be masters at knowing how to locate every piece of information they may need for their jobs.</p>

				<p>The purpose of this technical documentation is to provide a guide for some of the most important aspects of the job. By consolidating this information into a single document, I hope to help other succeed at their jobs, and in doing so, provide a better quality of service to their coworkers and their community as a whole.</p>

				<p>It should be known that this particular guide was written based on how a specific agency operates and is for informational purposes, only. It should <strong>not</strong> be blindly applied to any other agency, which likely has different protocols and organization.</p>
				<p>If you would like me to create a similar document for your specific agency, please feel free to contact me.</p>

			<article>
				<p>Most often, when a detail comes in, or if there's an overtime shift to be filled, the dispatcher must simply make the Officer in Charge aware, and s/he will handle it from there. However, there come times when the OIC is not available, and it falls on the dispatcher to get the shift or detail filled.</p>

			<header><h2>IMC Tips and Tricks</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>Things can quickly become chaotic in a Communications Center, especially if there's only 1 dispatcher on duty, who must often juggle a handful of tasks all at once.</p>
				<p>Since speed and accuracy are essential to excellent job performance, it's critical that dispatchers make use of IMC's built-in keyboard shortcuts, so that they can quickly complete many common tasks. Here are a few examples:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>F11</code> -- Start a New Call</li>
						<li><code>Shift + F11</code> -- Start a New Officer-Initiated Call</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F3</code> -- Dispatch Units to an Open Call</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F6</code> -- Mark Dispatched Units as Enroute</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F4</code> -- Arrive Units</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F5</code> -- Clear Units</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F9</code> -- List Additional Options for Fire/EMS Units</li>

			<article>
				<h3>FD Overview</h3>
				<p>Our fire station is staffed daily between the hours of 6am - 9pm. The number of firefigthers on duty at any given time is a function of their availability as well as the time of day.</p>

				<h4>BLS vs. ALS Ambulance</h4>
				<p>Our fire department is the primary BLS provider for the town. This means that they handle all BLS medical emergencies on their own. Calls meeting ALS criteria (based on EMD criteria) shall also require the dispatcher to notify an out-of-town ALS ambulance for response. <strong>NB: This is in addition to dispatching our BLS ambulance</strong></p>

				<p>Our ALS Providers are:
					<ul>
						<li>Byfield/Newbury Fire Department -- Monday - Friday, 7am - 5pm</li>
						<li>Atlantic Ambulance -- Nights/Weekends/Holidays/Any time Byfield/Newbury is not available.</li>
					</ul>
			</article>

			<article>
				<p>Fire Dispatch is entirely its own beast. In fact, interacting with the fire department is one of the hardest parts for new dispatchers, in large part because the FD operates with their own standards, procedures, and protocols.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Echo Dispatching</h3>
				<p>One unique aspect of Fire Dispatch is the concept of <em>Echo Dispatching</em>. Echo Dispatching is when a dispatcher repeats the gist of each radio transmission from fire department personnel.</p>
				<p>It is important to remember that it's called <em>Echo</em> Dispatching <strong>not</strong> <em>Mirror</em> Dispatching -- The goal is not to repeat every transmission word-for-word; rather, dispatchers should strive to relay the most important parts of each message.
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3>Fire vs. Medical vs. Still Alarm</h3>
				<p>The Fire Department asks that 3 unique tones be used, depending on the nature of the call as well as the time of day:
					<ul>
						<li>Fire All Call</li>
						<li>Medical</li>
						<li>Still Alarm</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
