				<p>Being successful in a Public Safety Communications Center means knowing how to quickly and accurately access a wide array of information and resources.</p>

				<p>Dispatchers are not expected to know everything; however, they should be masters at knowing how to locate every piece of information they may need for their jobs.</p>

				<p>The purpose of this technical documentation is to provide a guide for some of the most important aspects of the job. By consolidating this information into a single document, I hope to help other succeeed at their jobs, and in doing so, provide a better quality of service to their coworkers and their community as a whole.</p>

User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query. -->
