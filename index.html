			<article>
				<p>Being successful in a Public Safety Communications Center means knowing how to quickly and accurately access a wide array of information and resources.</p>

				<p>Dispatchers are not expected to know everything; however, they should be masters at knowing how to locate every piece of information they may need for their jobs.</p>

				<p>The purpose of this technical documentation is to provide a guide for some of the most important aspects of the job. By consolidating this information into a single document, I hope to help other succeed at their jobs, and in doing so, provide a better quality of service to their coworkers and their community as a whole.</p>

			<header><h2>Radios</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>The radio system is the lifeblood of the Communications Center. The majority of your communication will be via radio, so it's imporant that you're comfortable on the air.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Console Operations</h3>
				<p>The dispatch room has two idential radio consoles. The available channels are:
					<ul class="list">
						<li><strong>Police</strong> -- This channel is dedicated to our primary police frequency.</li>
						<li><strong>Fire</strong> -- This channel is dedicated to our primary fire frequency.</li>
						<li><strong>North District</strong> -- This channel is dedicated to the BAPERN North District (of which we belong). Think of it as a mutual aid police radio network. Use this for BOLOs or requesting immediate assistance from surrounding cities and towns.</li>
						<li><strong>District 15</strong> -- This channel is the county fire channel, allowing us communication between District 15 Control as well as other fire departments in our region.</li>
						<li><strong>DPW Primary</strong> -- This is the primary channel used by our highway department.</li>
						<li><strong>UHF</strong> -- This channel corresponds to the UHF radio in dispatch. It allows us to communicate with surrounding agencies (mostly police)</li>
						<li><strong>VHF</strong> -- This channel corresponds to the VHF radio in dispatch. It allows us to communicate with surrounding agencies (mostly fire)</li>
						<li><strong>Seabrook 800Mhz</strong> -- An 800 Mhz radio that allows us to communicate with the State on their frequency during emergencies.</li>
						<li><strong>Region 3 EMS</strong> -- This channel is our connection to Northeast C-MED, which coordinates mutual aid ambulances around the region, and who also informs us when certain essential hospital functions (e.g. a CAT Scan) is down.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>You will mostly be interacting with the Police and Fire channels, but it's important to keep an ear out for the other radios, as important information comes across them every day.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>UHF/VHF Radios</h3>
				<p>Take note of the two separate radios in dispatch, one label UHF (Ultra High frequency), and the other labeled VHF (Very High Frequency). These two radios allow the dispatcher to not only listen to surrounding cities and towns but also to dial in to a specific town's frequency and communicate over their channel. This is extremely useful if local units are dispatched mutual aid to another community, or if you need to relay a message to another agency.</p>
				<p>For example, let's say you take a call for an erratic car, last seen barrelling down a road that leads to another town. You first and foremost should put the BOLO out to your officers in town. But if they're out of position, then the likelihood of them catching up with the vehicle before it leaves town is very slim.</p>
				<p>You can, of course, inform the next town over by calling their dispatcher and relaying the information. However, this can take a considerable amount of time, as you must relay all the information to the other dispatcher, and they must then turn around and put the BOLO out to their officers. Additionally, this game of telephone increases the likelihood that information will be mixed up or misinterpreted.</p>
				<p>Try this instead: Take the UHF radio off scan mode, and navigate to the town you're trying to reach. Now, you can transmit over the dedicated UHF channel on your radio console, and you'll be broadcasting the BOLO to the neighboring town's officers, to their dispatcher, and to any other agency who may be listening (for example, a State Trooper driving through the area). Everyone gets the same message at the same exact time. Errors and miscommunications are minimized, and the no time is wasted getting the message out.</p>
				<p>The default channel for the UHF radio is BAPERN Areawide 3. In addition to monitoring the North District channel, we are also required to monitor this area-wide channel, which all other agencies in the region may communicate on.</p>
				<p>The default channel for the VHF radio is Light/Water, which is the channel our local Light and Water Departments use for communication. Keep an ear out for this one, as they sometimes try to reach you over the air.</p>

		<section id="Phones" class="main-section">
			<header><h2>Phones</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>The phone system is the primary way that the public interacts with us. We get scores of phone calls each day; ensuring that you're up to date on your phone skills will make your job infinitely easier</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Quick Tips</h3>
				<p>Here are some basics to keep in mind with our phone system:
					<ul class="list">
						<li>You must dial <kbd>8</kbd> to get an outside line.</li>
						<li>All of our police phone lines are recorded. You <strong>must</strong> advise callers that they're being recorded whenever you answer the phone, or if you're returning a phone call.</li>
						<li>The phone has an LCD screen, with the ability to toggle between different views on the screen. For example, if you're looking for the speed dials for the On Call Tow Company, use the arrows at the bottom of the display to navigate to page 3. Keep in mind that if you're on a different page when the phone rings, you will not be able to see which line is ringing if you're not on page 1; additionally, if you have someone on hold, you will not be able to see that they're still on hold unless you're on page 1. <em>Please remember to always navigate back to <strong>page 1</strong> when you're finished accessing the other screens</em>.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Transfer a Call to an Extension</h3>
				<p>To transfer a caller to someone in the station:
					<ol class="list">
						<li>Leave the caller connected (don't put them on hold).</li>
						<li>Press the speed dial extension of the person you're trying to reach.</li>
						<li>Once they answer, ask if they'd like to speak with the caller.</li>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>If they do wish to speak with the caller, simply hang up the phone to complete the transfer.</li>
								<li>If they <strong>do not</strong> wish to speak with the caller, press the "Cancel Transfer" button (which looks like a circle with an X in the middle) to be connected with the caller again.</li>
							</ul>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Transfer a Call to Voicemail</h3>
				<p>To transfer a caller to someone's voicemail:
					<ol class="list">
						<li>Leave the caller connected (don't put them on hold).</li>
						<li>Press the voicemail button (which looks like an envelope).</li>
						<li>Press the extension of the person whose voicemail box you're trying to reach.</li>
						<li>Hang up the phone to complete the transfer.</li>
					</ol>
				<p><strong>NB:</strong> Reserve Officers have voicemail, too, but they don't have speed dial extensions like the Full Time Officers do. To transfer a call to a Reserve's voicemail, press the voicemail button and then manually enter their mailbox number using the following format: <kbd>6</kbd> + <kbd>Badge Number</kbd>.
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Transfer a Call to an Outside Line</h3>
				<p>One of the coolest features of this phone system is the ability to transfer calls to outside phones. For example, you can transfer a call from CPAC directly to an officer on scene. The phone call is recorded throughout, which can be an important tool for the officers when they write their reports.</p>
				<p>To transfer a caller to an Outside Line:
					<ol class="list">
						<li>Leave the caller connected (don't put them on hold).</li>
						<li>Press the call transfer button.</li>
						<li>Dial the phone number of the person you're trying to reach using the following format: <kbd>8</kdb> + <kbd>1</kbd> + Area Code + Number.</li>
						<li>Hang up the phone to complete the transfer.</li>
					</ol>
					<p><strong>NB:</strong>You should never blindly transfer a caller to someone's cell phone. First off, you need to verify that the officer can access their cell phone. Second, the transferred call will show up on their caller ID as the station's phone number. They may answer thinking that they're speaking with Dispatch, when in reality they're talking to someone else.</p>
			</article>
		</section>	

		<section id="On_Call_Lists" class="main-section">
			<header><h2>On Call Lists</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>The purple On Call binder is where you'll find contact info for the following agencies and organizations:
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Tow Company</li>
						<li>Police</li>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>Sgt</li>
							<li>Detective</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Highway Dept</li>
						<li>Light Dept</li>
						<li>Water Dept</li>
						<li>Bail Clerk</li>
						<li>Judge</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>If you're working when an updated On Call list comes in (usually via fax), please feel free to update the book. Additionally, sometimes the Light Department (for example) will call with sporadic daily changes to the rotation. Ensure that you document these nuances in the binder, so that everyone is on the same page.</p>
			</article>
		</section>

		<section id="Details_and_Overtime_Shifts" class="main-section">
			<header><h2>Details and Overtime Shifts</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>Most often, when a detail comes in, or if there's an overtime shift to be filled, the dispatcher must simply make the Officer in Charge aware, and s/he will handle it from there. However, there come times when the OIC is not available, and it falls on the dispatcher to get the shift or detail filled.</p>
				</p>
				<p>Grab either the Detail or Overtime binder, depending on what you're filling. The list is the order in which people are to be called. Call and text each person based on that order. Document the time you contacted them, as well as their reply.</p>

		<section id="IMC_Tips_and_Tricks" class="main-section">
			<header><h2>IMC Tips and Tricks</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>Things can quickly become chaotic in a Communications Center, especially if there's only 1 dispatcher on duty, who must often juggle a handful of tasks all at once.</p>
				<p>Since speed and accuracy are essential to excellent job performance, it's critical that dispatchers make use of IMC's built-in keyboard shortcuts, so that they can quickly complete many common tasks. Here are a few examples:</p>
				<p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li><code>F11</code> -- Start a New Call</li>
						<li><code>Shift + F11</code> -- Start a New Officer-Initiated Call</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F3</code> -- Dispatch Units to an Open Call</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F6</code> -- Mark Dispatched Units as Enroute</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F4</code> -- Arrive Units</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F5</code> -- Clear Units</li>
						<li><code>Alt + F9</code> -- List Additional Options for Fire/EMS Units</li>
				</p>

		<section id="Police_Dispatch" class="main-section">
			<header><h2>Police Dispatch</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>The majority of your job is to function as a police dispatcher. This is not to say that you won't be called upon to perform other tasks. Whereas other departments in town go home at night (but remain 'on call'), the police department is a 24/7 operation. Therefore, it is critical that you hone your PD Dispatch skills.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Live Dispatching</h3>
				<p>I am an enormous proponent of what I've come to call "Live" Dispatching. By this I mean relaying call information to responding units in near real-time.</p>
				<p>One way to get better at this is to anticipate the needs and actions of your field units before they call. For example, if you know an officer is running radar, you can anticipate that their next radio communication will most likely be them letting you know they're on a stop.</p>
				<p>When I'm working, as soon as I hear an officer radio in during a radar assignment, I anticipate that they'll be making a stop. So rather than sit idly, I'll pull up the necessary screens to run the plate, so that I can enter it directly into the computer as the officer is relaying the info to me. I'll hit <kbd>F10</kbd> before they finish repeating the plate back to me. This allows me to scan the info quickly and to find all the relevant information ASAP.</p>
				<p>The same goes with calls for service. If you take a phone call from someone reporting an erratic operator, don't waste time writing all the info down before putting the BOLO out over the air. Start by getting officers rolling toward the general area of the call. Tell them briefly what they're looking for, and let them know that you're working on more information. Until you give a call's location, all responding units must sit and wait until they know which way to go. If you take 3 minutes to gather all the information before broadcasting the BOLO, then the probability that the car/person is no longer in the area.</p>
				<p>As a final example, here's how I handle calls for burglar alarms:
					<ol class="list">
						<li>Ascertain the exact location of the alarm activation</li>
						<li>Inquire if there are any specific zones activated (e.g. "Garage Entry")</li>
						<li>Ask the alarm company tech to stay on the line while you dispatch.</li>
						<li>Let the officers know the address and nature of the call.</li>
						<li>Ask the alarm company tech for their operator name/ID and a callback number for them. Provide your badge number to them.</li>
						<li>Let them know units are en route, then disconnect to start entering the call into IMC if you haven't already.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>This entire exchange should take no more than 60 seconds. The sooner you dispatch units to a call, the sooner they'll get on scene. If there's an actual B&E in progress, then the liklihood of the suspect getting caught increases dramatically if officers can get on scene ASAP.</p>

				<h2>Fire Dispatch Basics</h2>
			</header>

			<article>
				<h3>FD Overview</h3>
				<p>Our fire station is staffed daily between the hours of 6am - 9pm. The number of firefigthers on duty at any given time is a function of their availability as well as the time of day.</p>

				<h4>BLS vs. ALS Ambulance</h4>
				<p>Our fire department is the primary BLS provider for the town. This means that they handle all BLS medical emergencies on their own. Calls meeting ALS criteria (based on EMD criteria) shall also require the dispatcher to notify an out-of-town ALS ambulance for response. <strong>NB: This is in addition to dispatching our BLS ambulance</strong>.</p>

				<p>Our ALS Providers are:
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Byfield/Newbury Fire Department -- Monday - Friday, 7am - 5pm</li>
						<li>Atlantic Ambulance -- Nights/Weekends/Holidays/Any time Byfield/Newbury is not available.</li>
					</ul>
			</article>

			<article>
				<p>Fire Dispatch is entirely its own beast. In fact, interacting with the fire department is one of the hardest parts for new dispatchers, in large part because the FD operates with their own standards, procedures, and protocols.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Echo Dispatching</h3>
				<p>One unique aspect of Fire Dispatch is the concept of <em>Echo Dispatching</em>. Echo Dispatching is when a dispatcher repeats the gist of each radio transmission from fire department personnel.</p>
				<p>It is important to remember that it's called <em>Echo</em> Dispatching <strong>not</strong> <em>Mirror</em> Dispatching -- The goal is not to repeat every transmission word-for-word; rather, dispatchers should strive to relay the most important parts of each message.
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3>Fire vs. Medical vs. Still Alarm</h3>
				<p>The Fire Department asks that 3 unique tones be used, depending on the nature of the call as well as the time of day:
					<ul class="list">
						<li>Fire All Call</li>
						<li>Medical</li>
						<li>Still Alarm</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				
			</article>
		</section>

		<section id="Working_Fire_Protocol" class="main-section">
			<header><h2>Working Fire Protocol</h2></header>
			<article>
				<p>Facilitating interagency communications as a solo dispatcher during a working fire is extremely chaotic. There is a lot to do in a very short amount of time, so being well versed in the Working Fire Protocol will make your job infinitely easier when you you handle communications during a fire.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>Live Fire Dispatching</h3>
				<p>As with Police Dispatching, it is vital that you develop a strong ability to live dispatch for fire calls, too.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3>Calling for Mutual Aid</h3>
				<p>First off, you should notify District 15 Control as soon as you have confirmation of a working fire. They coordinate the mutual aid availability for every other town in our Fire District, so it's important for them to know when changes occur with our availablility or that of neighboring agencies.</p>
				<p>Follow our Mutual Aid Run Card to determine which town to contact for a first alarm fire, as well as what type of resource they should send (an Engine, a Ladder, or perhaps a RIT team), and where they're needed (to the scene or for station coverage).</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3>Hydrants</h3>
				<p>One of the Fire Department's primary tasks when getting on scene of a working fire is to establish a secure and continuous source of water. Bear in mind that the pump on a typical fire engine can move water at a rate of up to 1000 gallons/minute. Each fire engine is equipped with a water tank, but this may only be 750 gallons. It's not designed to fight an entire fire; rather, it's purpose is to allow firefighters to start putting water on the fire before they establish a continuous supply.</p>
				<p>The best source of a continuous water supply is the town's hydrant system. For this reason, it is critical that you alert the FD to the location of the nearest hydrants as soon as the first engine signs on the air responding.</p>
				<p>The Hydrant List can be found on the dispatch computer by navigating to the P: Drive, then to the Dispatch Computer folder, and then to the Fire folder.</p>
